# handshake — entry handshake protocol

> 語言 / Language: [繁體中文](handshake.zh-tw.md) · **English**

## Purpose

Any agent, on entry (new session, takeover, handoff), first does a "handshake": **read existing docs in a fixed order → extract key points → echo back understanding**, then start work. The goal is auditable handoff and avoiding the drift/misunderstanding caused by "acting without reading". This is the executable form of the Session startup check.

## What to read (fixed order)

1. **Current branch & working tree**: confirm which branch you're on (see branch-isolation) and run `git status` — note any uncommitted changes for step 5's reconciliation; afterwards only reference that branch's requirements/acceptance. **Switching branches mid-session counts as a new entry: redo this handshake.** **No git?** Commit anchoring, the commit scan and `--commits-since` don't apply — state the degraded mode in your ack; CHG step ticks + the worklog become the only interruption markers, reconciliation is manual (files vs CHG steps). Recommend `git init` before anything else.
2. **`docs/ai-guideline.md`**: the current Guideline — goals, scope, current **version**, open items. **Skill version self-check**: compare the `Skill:` version in recent CHG/ACC against your running skill version — records newer than your skill mean **you are outdated: upgrade before working** (an old skill silently misses newer rules); records older than your skill are fine (new rules apply prospectively, see doc-integrity).
3. **`docs/knowledge/`**: known errors and **user correction directives** (see knowledge) — avoid repeats; high priority.
4. **`docs/coordination.md`**: org/claims — your role, locked scope, read/write permission, others' in-progress work.
5. **`docs/changes/` + `docs/acceptance/`**: any unclosed stage (CHG not accepted / missing ACC); close first, then start new. **Reconcile the working tree**: every uncommitted change noted in step 1 must map to some CHG's modification steps (or a worklog entry); an unmatched change means an interrupted or ungoverned edit — treat it as drift (see doc-integrity) and resolve it before new work. **Scan commit history too**: from the last governed anchor (the newest ACC's Commit field, or the last commit referencing a CHG) to HEAD, every commit message should reference a CHG id (see modification-guide "commit granularity"); a commit referencing none is ungoverned work — same drift handling (in squash-merge workflows the trunk is scanned at squash-commit granularity — see modification-guide "PR / squash / rebase"). Machine aid: `scripts/doc_integrity_check.py --commits-since <anchor>`.
6. **`docs/structure/`**: current structure, check for drift vs code (see doc-integrity).

## Key points (must capture)

- **Current branch** and its scope (don't reference other branches' requirements).
- **Current Guideline version** and open items.
- **Your role / read-write permission** (role_refs, tools allowlist).
- **Known errors and correction directives** (knowledge, high priority).
- **Unclosed stages** (hanging acceptance).
- **Working-tree state** (uncommitted changes mapped to a CHG, or flagged as drift).
- **In-progress claims** (avoid collisions; stale claims → see cross-agent takeover).

## Echo acknowledgement (handshake ack — required before acting)

After reading, **echo your understanding in a few lines before acting**:

```
[handshake] branch: <branch> | role: <role> (RW: <scope>)
worktree: <clean / uncommitted → mapped to CHG-… / unmatched → drift>; commits since <anchor>: <all governed / N ungoverned>
current Guideline: v<x>; unclosed: <CHG-… pending acceptance / none>
must follow (knowledge): <key entries / none>
next I will: <one line>; halt: <per autonomy, this gate auto/halt>
```

The echo lets a human/parent intercept misunderstanding before you act; across agents it's proof of "I took over correctly".

## Tiered handshake: full vs scoped (subagents)

Reading everything doesn't scale, and a dispatched subagent doesn't need the whole picture. Two tiers:

**Full handshake** — solo entry, the orchestrator / main agent, taking over a whole project, and **peer parallel agents with no dispatching parent** (no one composes a briefing for you → you carry the full duty yourself): read the full list above.

**Scoped handshake** — a **dispatched subagent**. Its context is keyed by four things: **branch + structural location (module) + requirement (its task's FR/CHG slice) + location (locked file scope)**.

- **Reads**: the **dispatch briefing** its parent composed from the full view (task, locked scope, R/W permission, relevant contract/interface excerpts, relevant structure-doc sections, knowledge entries that are global or tagged for its scope) + its own scope's structure docs and worklog.
- **Does not read**: other branches; other modules' claims / worklogs / handshakes. The branch is inherited from the dispatch — never reference another branch's sources.
- **Global knowledge pierces scope**: directives tagged "all branches / global" are mandatory for every tier — the one thing that crosses scope boundaries.
- **Scoped ack goes to the parent** (not broadcast): `[handshake:scoped] branch | structure | requirement | locked location | next: <one line>`.
- **The parent audits**: it alone has the full view — it composes the briefing before dispatch, and on receiving the ack checks the **four keys match the dispatch**; a mismatch is intercepted before the subagent acts. Cross-scope consistency stays the parent's job (impact analysis, integration acceptance). A subagent that discovers an out-of-scope dependency **reports up** — it does not read sideways or self-expand (see agent-hierarchy).

**The cost, stated plainly**: a scoped subagent cannot catch what the briefing missed. Compensating controls: the parent's impact analysis (CHG), integration acceptance for parallel work, and V1's wider-view acceptance. The trade is deliberate — cheap, parallel, bounded workers + one accountable full-view reviewer.

## Mid-session re-sync (mini-handshake)

The full handshake happens at entry — but long sessions lose context to compaction, and "the docs are the truth" only holds if you actually re-read them. Re-read the Guideline + the active CHG (+ knowledge when directives are in play) and emit a 2-line mini-ack:

```
[re-sync] CHG-…: step <n>/<m> done; branch <b>; next: <one line>
constraints re-confirmed: <key knowledge / guideline points / none>
```

Triggers: **every autonomy gate**; **before starting acceptance**; **on signs of compaction** (you can't precisely recall an earlier decision — don't guess from memory, re-read); and periodically in long sessions (suggest every ~20 turns).

## Relation to the rest of the flow

- Concretizes the Session startup check; the read list maps to knowledge / branch-isolation / doc-integrity / coordination / autonomy.
- Machine aids: use `scripts/role_loadout.py` for the role's references to load; `scripts/doc_integrity_check.py` to scan for unclosed items and drift.
- If you find unclosed items / drift / conflict → handle it per the matching reference before starting new work.
